My Github account was created today, 9/23/23, with the username monoguts0, which is consistent with my other online accounts.
I made my repository right after creating my account, I clicked the + and filled out the repository information following the instructions in the lab word doc.
To clone my repository I downloaded the Github desktop app, logged in and clicked the File tab on the top left corner of the app, and clicked clone repository. I cloned the repository to a folder I made in my CTI-110 folder named "Github".
